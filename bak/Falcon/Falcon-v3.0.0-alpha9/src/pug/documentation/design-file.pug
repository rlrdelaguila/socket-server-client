    p.mb-1.mt-2 We have designed #{name} initially directly with code. After receiving multiple requests from our customers for design files, we recreated the design in Figma.
  
  .card
    .card-body
      p This is an early demo of Figma files. All the design is not yet recreated with Figma. But hopefully, we will port all the layouts in the next couple of weeks.
      h5(data-anchor) To play with design:
      ul
        li 
          a(href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank") Download Figma
        li Open the Figma link from the 
          code README.md
        li The file is "read-only", so you'll have to duplicate it! Go to your grid of documents in Figma, click the ellipsis icon on 
          span.text-primary #{name} (Distributed)
          | , and then "Duplicate" to create an editable version.
